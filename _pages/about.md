Hi, I'm Charlie.

I am a Senior Computer Vision Research Scientist at Mathworks' Advanced Research & Technology Office, where I aim to accelerate and amplify the impact of academic research on MathWorks' products. Before this, I was a research scientist at Meta (aka Facebook, when I was there!) Reality Labs, working on depth sensors for AR and VR products. 

I earned a PhD in Electrical Engineering from Boston University, where I worked on [exciting problems](https://open.bu.edu/handle/2144/43116) in computational imaging as a member of Vivek K Goyal's [STIR lab](https://vivekgoyal.org/). Prior to that, I lived and grew up in the UK and received a Master's in Acoustical Engineering from the University of Southampton.
