Hi, I'm Charlie.

I am a Senior Computer Vision Research Scientist at Mathworks' Advanced Research & Technology Office, where I aim to accelerate and amplify the impact of academic research on MathWorks' products. Before this, I was a research scientist at Meta (aka Facebook, when I was there!) Reality Labs, working on depth sensors for AR and VR products. 

I have a PhD in Electrical Engineering from Boston University, where I worked on exciting computational imaging problems under the guidance of Vivek K Goyal.
